# Google-Developer-AMA-Transcripts

Since we will spend a whole 6 months in the Nanodegree, this repository is a more organized way for collecting the transcripts of AMA sessions as they will be a lot of them starting from beginning of the scholarship period. the process of showing Q&As based on categorizing the questions based on the track and whether it is a general or techinical. adding the feature of browsing using the time of the session for reading a session as a whole.

### **Categorizing is based on color code.**
*PS: Colors are chosen randomaly and they would be edited.*
* General: light grey
* Technical: purpule
* Android basics: green
* Android Advanced: yellow
* Front-end: blue
* Mobile web: red
